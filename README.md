# Puzzle Panel Solver
 A brute force method of solving the Puzzle Panel minigame from New Super Mario Bros. and SM64 DS.

Anyone remember the Puzzle Panel minigame? It was, at the time, extremely difficult for me, and still is pretty difficult in the later levels. That is why I made a program to solve it for you.
This program is pretty easy to use, and while it may not be the most intuitive (since it's only using the console), all of the puzzles in the original game are easily able to be done with this.
Due to the nature of this solving method, bigger puzzles and more moves do take a while to solve, but the puzzles found in the minigame will be super fast.
